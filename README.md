Abstract:
Performing inference on function-valued parameters, such as the regression function and conditional average treatment effect, presents fundamental challenges, particularly in nonparametric models. This paper proposes a nonparametric procedure for testing hypotheses about the equality of a function-valued parameter and a specified real-valued parameter. Specifically, we consider a class of hypotheses that assess whether a statistical functional, expressed as a function of a conditional distribution, equals its counterpart based on the unconditional distribution. We propose a test statistic based on the norm  of the difference between the two functionals, while addressing the degeneracy issue in characterizing the null limiting distribution. We discuss as an example how our proposed test can be used to test for heterogeneous average treatment effect in both randomized and observational studies. Simulation studies demonstrate strong performance, and we further apply the method to identify predictive biomarkers for adjuvant chemotherapy response in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
